# Virtualization of HOL4 in Isabelle

This is the implementation accompanying the ITP 2019 paper "Virtualization of HOL4 in Isabelle" by Fabian Immler, Jonas
RÃ¤dle, and Makarius Wenzel.

This file describes how to set up Poly/ML, HOL4, and Isabelle for hol4isabelle on Linux.
It shall set up a hierarchy of directories like this.
HOL must be a subdirectory of hol4isabelle, the location of isabelle and polyml is not too relevant.
```
hol4isabelle
|
|__ HOL
|
|__ isabelle
|
|__ polyml
```

## Installation (Linux)

### Poly/ML

In order to build HOL, download and install [Poly/ML (5.8)](https://polyml.org/download.html)


### HOL4
Clone HOL (the version below is tested to work) and build the kernel
(this generates a couple of SML files that are required to run hol4isabelle,
e.g., `src/postkernel/TheoryDatTokens.sml`)

```
git clone https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL.git
cd HOL
git checkout 7e03303e51f

poly < tools/smart-configure.sml
bin/build --seq=tools/sequences/kernel
cd ..
```

### Isabelle

Download Isabelle2019 from ``https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2019/``.
From here on we refer to the main Isabelle executable `Isabelle2019/bin/isabelle` as simply `isabelle`

Alternatively (in order to work with the repository):
```
hg clone http://isabelle.in.tum.de/repos/isabelle/rev/Isabelle2019
isabelle components -I
isabelle components -a
isabelle build -b HOL
```

## Run

### Explore transfer of theorems between HOL4 and Isabelle/HOL:
```
isabelle jedit -d . -l HOL4_Core_Isabelle Transfer_Example.thy
```

### Explore build of the Isabelle HOL4-Core (and all of its dependencies):
```
isabelle jedit -d . -l HOL HOL4_Core_Isabelle.thy
```

### Explore build of the Original HOL4-Core (and all of its dependencies):
```
isabelle jedit -d . -l Pure HOL4_Core_Original.thy
```

## OpenTheory import

* Theory ``OpenTheoryImport`` requires the Isabelle-OpenTheory importer as a subdirectory in
``hol4isabelle``:

```
git clone https://github.com/xrchz/isabelle-opentheory.git
cd isabelle-opentheory
git checkout f04496c
cd ..
```

* build OpenTheory .art files with HOL4's loggingKernel:

```
cd HOL
bin/build cleanAll
bin/build --otknl
```


## Notes for Installation on Windows

This requires
* The [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), with Ubuntu 18.04
* An installation of the [Isabelle2019 application](http://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/Isabelle2019.exe)

Most of the installation is just like under Linux, with the following exceptions:
* especially for polyml, make sure that everything is installed in a directory under the WSL home directory
* all commands involving that involve "./isabelle/bin/isabelle" must be executed in the Cygwin-Terminal (in the
  Isabelle2019) folder
* before building HOL, do
    ```
    echo 'val HOLDIR = "c:/path/to/hol4isabelle/HOL"' > tools-poly/poly-includes.sml
    ```
  because otherwise (due to WSL) `HOLDIR = "/mnt/c/path/to/hol4isabelle/HOL"` and this will confuse hol4isabelle.
